***Development Setup Instructions:***

1. In VSCode, activate the virtual environment:
    Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette
    Type `Python: Create Environment` into the command palette
    Select `Venv` from the list
    If prompted, select some variant of Python 3.9 as your interpreter
2. Ensure that your terminal in VSCode says `(.venv)` in green. If it does, you're all set!

If prompted to update dependencies, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` in VSCode's terminal. Ensure that your terminal says `(.venv)` before you do this.
